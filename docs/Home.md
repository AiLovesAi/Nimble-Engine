# Nimble Game Engine Wiki

**Nimble is in its very early stages of development. It began as a way for me to make multiple games in C without having to edit almost all of the code to get the base game out of the final project. It is currently not near its release stage and will likely be useless for your own projects in its current stage. If you are interested in using it, give it time.**

Nimble is a cross-platform, light 3D game engine written in C, and is designed to run efficiently. It is free to use under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

All the libraries Nimble utilizes are free to use under their own licenses. Make sure you follow their licenses as well, which can be found in [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/a3ology/Nimble-Game-Engine/blob/master/LICENSE.md). Keep in mind people can update their licenses, so make sure to double-check them. I try to make it as easy as possible for you by making all headers include a license file, so the license gets written in plain-text in the compiled binaries. If you remove that, you best know what you are doing.
